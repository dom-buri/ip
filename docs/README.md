# User Guide

### Dommi - Task Manager Chatbot
Dommi is a desktop app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Dommi can get your tasks management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer.
1. Download the latest `dommi.jar` from [here](https://github.com/dom-buri/ip/releases/tag/A-Release).
1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your task management.
1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar dommi.jar` command to run the application.
A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.
